# F1_VRexplore
This repository shows an example of exploring the feasibily of rendering scientific data in VR created as part of the final thesis.
It utilizes GitHub's feature to host static pages using the feature called GitHub Pages. The link for the current work in available under the GitHub Pages section of the settings menu of the repository. Upon clicking the link, you will directed a webpage containing a model of an F1 car. 

Desktop/Laptop users: The webpage open as usual and basic manipulation of the model, like pan, zoom and rotate can be done as available in any CAD softfare. To explore the scene in VR, the WebXR Chrome extension must be added to the browser. This emulates the working of VR where the screen is split into 2 parts meant for each eye. The 'exploration' can be done by clicking the left controller button provided by the emulator control panel.

Phone Users: The link can be accessed through the mobile phone and similar to what is seen on desktop. To open in VR, the Google Cardboard app must be downloaded. Then press the ENTER VR button to render the model in VR. Place the phone in a VR headset. You can move around the scene by pressing the button the VR headset.

The same can be achieved in teathered VR devices by performing additional set up steps.
